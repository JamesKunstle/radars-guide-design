# About

RADARS (Reprogrammable ADAR Sensors) is a technology leveraging ADAR enzymes to gate payload expression in eukaryotic organisms by specific sets of RNA molecules. RADARS is developed to track RNA molecules inside a cell by ratiometrically turning on a selected cargo protein according to the target RNA expression. RADARS generally consists of three parts: An optional first part is a normalizing reporter module that is constructively expressed inside the cell, this can often be used to facilitate flow cytometry and cell selection. The second part is the RNA sensor which can be reprogramed to match any target RNA species inside the cell through simple RNA base pairing rule. The last part is the cargo module, which is only released upon detection of the specific RNA inside the cell. All parts are modular and can be reprogramed to any arbitrary proteins of interest or RNA of interest.
